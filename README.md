# Hypothesis-testing-using-data-analytics

An end-to-end data analytics project focused on analyzing customer behavior using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to generate actionable business insights.

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer transaction data to understand patterns in:

Payment methods

Fare amounts

Trip distances

The objective is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

🔄 Project Workflow
Data Collection → Data Cleaning & Transformation → Exploratory Data Analysis → Visualization & Insights

Steps Involved:

Data Extraction

Collected raw customer behavior data from source files.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing values

Removed outliers

Standardized data formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis

Payment method comparison

Statistical analysis (Q–Q plots)

Visualization

Built clear and informative visualizations

Highlighted trends and patterns in customer behavior

📈 Key Analyses
🔹 Fare Amount Distribution

Fare values show a bimodal distribution

Higher fare amounts are more frequently associated with card payments

🔹 Trip Distance Distribution

Trip distances are right-skewed

Most trips fall within short distances (around 1–1.5 miles)

Longer trips are dominated by card transactions

🔹 Payment Type Breakdown

Card payments are the dominant payment method

Cash payments still represent a significant portion of transactions

🔹 Statistical Insights

Q–Q plot shows a good fit with theoretical quantiles

Deviations at higher values indicate extreme customer behavior

💡 Key Insights

💳 Card payments dominate, especially for higher fares and longer trips

📊 Multiple customer segments suggested by bimodal fare distribution

🚕 Short-distance trips are the most common customer behavior

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Power BI

Interactive dashboards

Visual storytelling

Statistics
